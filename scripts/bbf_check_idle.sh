# Script to check idle state
#
# This script is used to determine if the device is in idle state or not
# And any idle state checking should be implemented here
# The value returned by this script is more important because based on it, will decide whether the image can be activated or not
# If (returned idle state == '0'), device is in idle state and can be activated. Otherwise, '1'
